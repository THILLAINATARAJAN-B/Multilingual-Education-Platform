# Education Platform

**Hack Beyond Limit - 2nd Place Winner**  
*Rathinam College of Arts and Science, Coimbatore*

## Overview
This Education Platform is designed to revolutionize how students and educators interact with content, offering cutting-edge tools to enhance learning experiences. The platform integrates a series of intelligent features that utilize state-of-the-art technologies like YOLO, OCR, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), BART, Mixtral-8x, and GroQ, making it a one-stop solution for converting video to PDF, summarizing and questioning content, generating notes, and more.

The platform was recognized for its innovation by securing 2nd place at **Hack Beyond Limit** conducted at Rathinam College of Arts and Science, Coimbatore.

## Key Features

### 1. **Video to PDF Conversion (YOLO to OCR to PDF)**
   - **Input**: Video File
   - **Output**: PDF Document
   - The platform extracts relevant text and images from videos, converting them into a comprehensive PDF. The process uses **YOLO** for object detection and **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** for extracting text, ultimately outputting a detailed PDF.

### 2. **RAG Content Summarizer**
   - **Input**: Any content (e.g., documents, articles)
   - **Output**: A concise summary
   - The **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** model intelligently summarizes content by retrieving relevant information from large datasets and generating a precise, high-quality summary.
   - The platform allows users to ask **questions** about the summarized content, receiving accurate responses based on the context.

### 3. **MCQ Generation**
   - **Input**: PDF Document
   - **Output**: Customizable number of MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions)
   - Using the **BART model**, the platform automatically generates MCQs based on the content of an input PDF. Users can specify how many questions they need, making this tool ideal for teachers preparing exams or quizzes.

### 4. **Notes Generation (English)**
   - **Input**: PDF Document
   - **Output**: Notes in English
   - Powered by **Mixtral-8x** and **B-32768**, this feature generates detailed, coherent notes in English from any input PDF. Ideal for students who need concise, digestible information from long-form content.

### 5. **RAG for Tamil Content and Doubt Questioning**
   - **Input**: Tamil PDF Document
   - **Output**: Summarized content and answers in Tamil
   - This feature leverages **RAG** to summarize content in Tamil and allows users to ask doubts in Tamil. The system answers queries in Tamil, ensuring users receive localized and relevant responses.

### 6. **Notes Generation (Tamil)**
   - **Input**: Tamil PDF Document
   - **Output**: Notes in Tamil
   - Similar to the English note generation feature, this tool uses **Mixtral-8x7B-32768** and **GroQ** for efficient note generation in Tamil, making the platform highly useful for Tamil-speaking users.
