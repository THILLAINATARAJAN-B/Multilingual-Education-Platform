**Title: 0.82 - Educational Resource Challenges**

**Problem Statement**

There are two primary issues affecting students in underserved communities:

1. **Limited Native Language Resources**: Students face a lack of comprehensive and high-quality educational materials in their native languages. This makes it harder for them to understand key concepts and access online resources, which are already limited in these communities.

2. **Inefficient Learning Process**: Two key issues hinder the learning process:
   * **Time-Consuming Note-Taking**: Students spend hours taking notes from lengthy lectures and textbooks, leaving little time for focused exam preparation.
   * **Lack of Personalization**: Most educational resources are static and fail to cater to the specific needs of individual learners, making the learning process less effective and leading to poor performance in academics.
